           <p>I'm Ariel Schilling, a 29 y/o math tutor from Texas.</p>
           <p>I've had adventures all over the world, but my current adventure is learning to code.
            So far I've studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
           </p>
           <p>Sometimes it gets really discouraging. Sometimes it gets really close to being my 13th reason.</p>
           <p>But I'm still here, still trying! If you have any advice or words of encouragement, 
            please feel free to send them my way.</p>
        </div>
